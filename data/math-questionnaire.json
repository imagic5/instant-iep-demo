  "comments": "Clark demonstrates exceptional mathematical aptitude. His ability to visualize and solve complex problems is remarkable. He shows a natural intuition for mathematical relationships and can often find elegant solutions to challenging problems. While his computational abilities are outstanding, he would benefit from developing more disciplined habits in showing his work systematically. This would help eliminate occasional errors that occur when he works too quickly. Clark has extraordinary potential in mathematics and could excel in advanced studies in this field."
